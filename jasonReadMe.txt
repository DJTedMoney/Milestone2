Here is what I have finished:

a camera that looks at the play area, size 1000

a light

a green background of size 220 by 220

3 power pellets, size 25 by 25

It is important to keep our scales to something like this.  C-sharp servers do NOT want to send data in decimal format, so it is crucial that our game be scaled up enough to send data as integers that is relevant but not over powering.  



What we need:

keyboard inputs for player to respond to

collision between player and pellet

collision between player and wall

keyboard inputs:  input to player, passed to client, request sent to fakeServer
response generated by fakeServer
command to change velocity sent from fakeServer back to client, and back to player
player velocity changes

Client to communicate to fakeServer

string method comms to send info from player to client to server

server to interpret message from player

server to detect all collisions and generate messages at the appropriate time
